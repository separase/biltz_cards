# Blitz Card Game Instructions:

### Welcome to the Blitz! Below you will find a set of instuctions on how to play the Card Game Blitz!
<br>
<br>

## The End Goal:
The aim is to get as close as possible to the number 31 **IN THE SAME SUIT.** This means that only cards in the same suit count as points that you can use to get to 31 first. 
<br>

## How To Play:

Each player is first dealt 3 cards. Player One will then draw another card from the stack and decide whether he wants to keep it or place it in the discard pile. **THIS WILL REPEAT FOR ALL PLAYERS.** Once a player believes that they have the closest hand to 31, they can then choose to knock on the table and give the other players one more turn to try and get a better score. 
<br>

## Possible Outcomes:
If a player has exactly 31 points, once they knock the game instantly ends and the other players **DO NOT** receive another turn 
<br>
<br>
If there is a draw, the player with the highest value cards will win the game. 

## Card Values:
Ace Cards: 11 Points
<br>
Face Cards: 10 Points
<br>
All other cards are the value that is written on the card. For example a 3 of Hearts is worth 3 points.
